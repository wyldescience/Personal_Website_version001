I am a recent PhD graduand from the [Evolution and Ecology Research Centre](http://www.eerc.unsw.edu.au/) at the University of New South Wales. I am interested in a wide range of topics within evolutionary biology including; chemical communication, ageing, trait integration, sex-role reversal and sexual selection amongst many others! For my PhD in the [Bonduriansky lab](http://www.bonduriansky.net/index.htm) I used the neriid fly *Telostylinus angusticollis* to empircally investigate numerous environmental effects on reproductive allocation. 

I completed my MSc under the supervision of [Professor Gregory Holwell](https://gregholwell.com/) at the University of Auckland, New Zealand. I investigated the courtship and aggressive behaviours, and allometry of an unstudied species of fly, *Scordalus femoratus* (Helosciomyzidae), along with the community ecology of native carrion flies in the Waitakere ranges. I have a keen interest in insects (particularly flies) but am willing to work with anything if the organism suits the question! 

I am currently working on a number of projects with Professor Russell Bonduriansky and more recently, Professor John Hunt using the decorated cricket *Gryllodes sigillatus*. I am also a reviewing editor for the [*Journal of Evolutionary Biology*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14209101).
