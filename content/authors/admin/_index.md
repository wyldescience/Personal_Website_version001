I am a recent PhD graduand from the [Evolution and Ecology Research Centre] (http://www.eerc.unsw.edu.au/) at the University of New South Wales. I am interested in a wide range of topics within evolutionary biology including; chemical communication, ageing, trait integration, sex-role reversal and sexual selection amongst many others! For my PhD in the [Bonduriansky lab](http://www.bonduriansky.net/index.htm) I used the neriid fly *Telostylinus angusticollis* to investigate numerous environmental effects on reproductive allocation empirically. For my MSc I investigated courtship and aggressive behaviours, and allometry using an unstudied species of carrion fly, *Scordalus femoratus* (helosciomyzidae), native to New Zealand. I have a keen interest in insects (particularly flies) but am willing to work with anything if the organism suits the question! 

More recently, I have started work using the clonal springtail, *Folsomia candida* to examine environmental impacts on ageing and lifespan. I am also characterizing the behaviour of a native carrion fly, *Piophila vitrea*.
