I am a PhD graduate from the [Evolution and Ecology Research Centre] (http://www.eerc.unsw.edu.au/) at the University of New South Wales. I mostly study how the environment affects the evolution of reproductive allocation strategies but am also interested in communication, sex-role reversal and sexual selection amongst many other aspects of evolutionary ecology! For my PhD in the [Bonduriansky lab](http://www.bonduriansky.net/index.htm) I used the neriid fly *Telostylinus angusticollis* to investigate numerous environmental effects on reproductive allocation empirically. For my MSc I investigated courtship and aggressive behaviours, and allometry using an unstudied species of carrion fly, *Scordalus femoratus* (helosciomyzidae), native to New Zealand. I have a keen interest in insects (particularly flies) but am willing to work with anything if the organism suits the question! 

More recently, I have become interested in agent-based modelling to investigate the Bateman's principle and the evolution of ornamentation in sex-role reversed species. I have also dabbled in machine-learning techniques and am broadly interested in statistics, R coding and producing open and reproducible science.
